							<h3 id=title2><strong>My Uniqueness</strong></h3>
							<p><strong>Loving Me the Way God Made Me</strong></p>
								<p> Have you ever heard the term “eagle-
eyed”? It has become a catch phrase in many
cultures—and for good reasons. Most eagles
have eyes that face forward. They have eyes
so large that they cannot move them easily.
So, the eagle must turn his head to see to the
side. That means eagles are forward seeing.
Eagle’s eyesight is up to eight times better
than humans. It can spot a rabbit or fish up
to two miles away. Eagles also see in a great
amount of detail. They can adjust the focus
of their eyes at lightning speed. They keep a
sharp focus as they swoop down from the sky
and plunge in a fast dive toward their prize.
When eagles mate, they mate for life.
They work together to build a nest that
can reach up 9 ft. in diameter and weigh
up to two tons! The nesting pair will often
return to this nest over and over, repairing
and replacing it as needed. Since eagles can
live up to 30 years in the wild, that’s a lot
of nesting seasons. Both parents guard the
eggs in the nest. Their eggs are plain white
and only slightly bigger than a chicken’s
egg. The eagle may start out small, but it
becomes the King of Birds.<br>When hatched, the parents take turns
bringing food to the young. The adults
shelter the eaglets from bad weather and
intense heat by covering them with their
wings. As eaglets grow and take their first
flight, the adult birds do not abandon their
young. They often continue to bring them
some food and teach them hunting methods
for up to one year.
Eagles do not usually eat carrion. What’s
that you ask? It is otherwise known as
road kill, or better yet, crow pizza. They
hunt and fish for small game and fresh fish,
preferring life-giving foods. But if an eagle
does eat something that makes him sick, he
does something interesting. He flies to the
highest rock—and goes spread eagle—and
lies there letting the sun bake the poison
out of him.<br>God created you just the way
He wants you to be. He may have
doused you with freckles, given you
a silly laugh, or a bone structure that
makes you not fit into a size small—
but He is the Master Designer. And
He loves you—without hesitation.</p><p>Like the eagle, we often get
desperate and do things that we
know are not the right thing for us.
What a lesson we can learn from
the eagle. We need to go to the
Rock, the highest Rock, and like the
majestic bird, go spread eagle and let
the Son bake the poison out of us</p>

							<p><strong>Details ,Details, Details</strong></p>
								<p>It is worth paying careful attention to the details that will help us accomplish our goals. When it comess to our spiritual life,it is even more important to be guided by the firm principles of the word of God.Only guided by the compass of the Holy scriptures can we accomplish our mission and reach the destination that God has intended for us. Preparation means careful studying and training for the journey. It also means wearing proper gear of God's whole armor so that we might be prepared for the conflict that is before us.(Ephesians 6:13).E ven with careful planning and preparation we will encounter obstacles because "the devil  walks about roaring like a lion" (1 peter 5:8).Yet if we follow Jesus' example and press on in spite of the obstacles and temptations that come our way,He will help us reach the finish line.(Hebrews 12:1,2).

								<p>Importance of preparation. Even though we rely on the Spirit, we are not so foolish as to make no preparation. As St. Augustine once said, “Pray as though everything depended on God. Work as though everything depended on you.” Faith
								and preparation are not mutually exclusive.<br>Guidance. The ability to seek God’s will is a very precious gift. David had this in the presence of the Urim and the Thummim, the company of a prophet, and his own prophetic gift. You can find God’s will if you seek him with all your heart, since, if you’re a Christian, you possess the Holy Spirit of God who connects you with the very mind of Christ (1 Corinthians 2:10‐16)</p>

						<h4>The Effect of Diet on the Brain</h4>
						<p>We have only one brain and it would be well for each of us to keep it
in good thinking order. For the brain to function at maximum capac-
ity it must be supplied with good, nourishing food. What you eat affects
the mental as well as the physical health. Our brains need to be in good
health so that we may glorify God in all that we do and say. Having said
that, we need to realize that food taken into the body also affects our
brain health. Researchers studied over 950 brains for five years and came
up with some very interesting information on how to maintain our brain’s
health. With all of the talk about the increase of dementia and Alzheim-
ers it would be beneficial to pay close attention to what this article is
suggesting to keep our brains healthy.“Something as simple as eating more leafy veggies
could significantly slow down cognitive decline and keep
your brain healthier for a longer period of time. A new
study found that nutrients and vitamins found in plants
such as spinach, kale, collards and mustard greens help
keep your mental abilities sharp.</p>

						<h4>Idea Exchange</h4>
						<h5 style="color:blue">Fireflies</h5>
						<p>There are many wonderments in
the animal world, but few offer
such fascination as that of a sum-
mer evening aglow with the lights of
nature’s miniature light-bearers.
Fireflies, also known as lightning
bugs, are nocturnal insects of the
beetle family Lampyridae which
comes from the Greek lampein
meaning to shine. With an exo-
skeleton and two pairs of wings,
they tend to be brown or black and
soft-bodied, with front wings more
leathery than those of other beetles,
and abdomens that light up. Of the
more than 2,000 species of fireflies in
the world, only some come equipped
with the ability to glow.
The firefly begins as an egg secreted
in the earth. In many species, the egg
may already show a touch of lumines-
cence. In about three weeks, the eggs
hatch into larvae resembling sowbugs.
At this stage also, many species glow.
The lamp of a firefly is a nature
wonder, the most efficient ever made.
An incandescent light bulb has an
efficiency of about 10 percent; 90
percent of the power is lost in heat.
The firefly turns nearly...</p>
